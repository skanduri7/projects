The user is struggling with performing squats, finding them to feel heavier than expected, and is seeking advice or reasons for this issue.

video_summary:
### Structured Overall Summary

#### Strengths:
- The lifter exhibits good control during the eccentric phase and is attentive to the controlled descent of the bar, which is beneficial for muscle engagement and stability.
- There's a consistent focus on proper breathing techniques, with breath control being maintained throughout the lift phases.
- Foot placement is generally firm, contributing to a stable base and force generation.
- The lifter understands the importance of scapular retraction and the role of shoulder positioning, albeit not always executed perfectly.
- Engagement of appropriate muscles during the pressing phase demonstrates understanding of the movement pattern.
- The lift is performed with the presence of a spotter, indicating a commitment to safety.

#### Weaknesses:
- Wrist alignment issues, particularly on the left side, could lead to strain and negatively affect force transfer.
- Asymmetrical elbow and shoulder alignment could result in imbalanced force production and a higher risk of injury, as well as diminished pectoral engagement.
- Feet are sometimes not kept flat and stable on the ground, which compromises overall stability during the lift.
- Potential back arching may put stress on the spine and affect lifting efficiency.
- Some bar path deviations suggest that the lifter may struggle with maintaining the optimal trajectory throughout the lift.
- The grip width and hand positioning could be less than ideal, impacting force application and risking wrist health.

#### Common Patterns:
- The tendency of misalignment in wrist and elbow positions across multiple phases of the lift, suggesting a pattern of uneven technique.
- The recurring theme of emphasizing posture, alignment, and stability, including foot placement and back arch, demonstrates a core approach to improving lifting form.
- The base of support, including proper foot placement, core engagement, and the overall stability featured in the advice, points to common areas for improvement across most lifters.

#### Critical Points:
- Proper joint alignment, particularly for wrists and elbows, is critical for both preventing injury and maximizing force effectiveness.
- Consistent shoulder retraction and depression are necessary for stability and protection of the shoulder joints. 
- Maintaining a stable foot position and avoiding excessive back arching are key factors in proper lift mechanics and injury prevention.
- Control during each phase of the lift, especially the eccentric phase, is essential for setting up for a powerful concentric phase and maintaining safety.
- A properly managed breathing cycle, including inhaling on lowering and forceful exhalation on pressing, is essential for core stability and power.
- The application of a spotter, maintaining a balanced role between ensuring safety and enabling the lifter's autonomy, is crucial, especially with increased weights.
- Adjustments to grip width and bar path are vital to ensure balanced muscle load and reduce the risk of injury.
- It is imperative to keep the elbows at a recommended angle (approximately 45 degrees) to balance shoulder stress and optimize pectoral engagement.
- Coaching should reinforce the lifter's strengths, such as controlled descent and bar path awareness, while also addressing critical weaknesses and common patterns to reduce the risk of injury and enhance lifting performance.

session_summary:
The user's lifting session was primarily focused on squats, which they found to be heavier than expected. The video analysis showed that the user demonstrated good control during the eccentric phase of the lift, maintained proper breathing techniques, and had a generally firm foot placement. They also understood the importance of scapular retraction and muscle engagement during the pressing phase and ensured safety by having a spotter present.

However, there were several performance issues observed. The user had wrist alignment issues, particularly on the left side, which could lead to strain and impact force transfer. There was also asymmetrical elbow and shoulder alignment, which could result in imbalanced force production and a higher risk of injury. The user's feet were not always kept flat and stable on the ground, compromising overall stability during the lift. Potential back arching could put stress on the spine and affect lifting efficiency. Some bar path deviations suggested difficulty in maintaining the optimal trajectory throughout the lift. The grip width and hand positioning could also be improved.

The user showed a consistent pattern of misalignment in wrist and elbow positions across multiple phases of the lift. There was a recurring theme of emphasizing posture, alignment, and stability, including foot placement and back arch. The user's approach to improving lifting form focused on these areas.

Key points for the user to focus on include proper joint alignment, consistent shoulder retraction, maintaining a stable foot position, control during each phase of the lift, a properly managed breathing cycle, the application of a spotter, adjustments to grip width and bar path, and keeping the elbows at a recommended angle. Coaching should reinforce the user's strengths while addressing these critical weaknesses and common patterns to reduce the risk of injury and enhance lifting performance.

solution:
{'summary': "Your lifting form is a mess. You've got wrist alignment issues, particularly on the left side, and your elbow and shoulder alignment is asymmetrical. Your feet aren't always flat on the ground, which is messing with your stability. There's also potential back arching and bar path deviations, which are both safety hazards and efficiency killers. Your grip width and hand positioning need work, and your elbows are at a weird angle. You're committed to improving, which is great, but you need to sort these issues out if you want to see real progress and avoid injury.", 'mobility': {'action_items': ['Work on wrist mobility exercises to improve alignment, particularly on the left side.', 'Incorporate shoulder mobility drills into your routine to correct asymmetrical alignment.', 'Perform ankle mobility exercises to help keep your feet flat on the ground.']}, 'technique': {'action_items': ['Focus on maintaining a neutral spine to prevent back arching.', "Practice your bar path with lighter weights to ensure it's straight.", 'Adjust your grip width and hand positioning for optimal force transfer.', 'Keep your elbows at a recommended angle to balance shoulder stress and optimize pectoral engagement.']}, 'training': {'action_items': ['Incorporate stability exercises into your routine to improve overall balance and control.', 'Work on your breathing cycle to better manage intra-abdominal pressure during lifts.', 'Use a spotter for heavy lifts, but also work on improving your own control and stability.', 'Regularly review and adjust your lifting form, focusing on the areas identified.']}}
